		<h2 id="Pun"> What Are Puns? </h2>
		<p> Puns are wordplay, when you make a pun you're replacing a phrase in a senteance with another that sounds alike but has a different meaning.  For example a pun could be: Wow sir, you are very punny!
		<h3> How Do Puns Work? </h3>
		<p> Well to take our example from earlier, you take two words that sound the same and use one that has a different meaning for the same purpose as the other so pun and fun are simaler and you can make pun-ny, a twist of funny.  The best part about puns is the punchline is very simple to create and with practice and a good vocabulary you can be a master at it in no time. <p>
		<h4> Practicing </h4>
		<p> The best way to get good at puns is to practice, use the words from different topics to make puns in the following sentences. </p>
		<ul>
			<li> Foods: berry, steak, peach </li>
			<li> Animals: bear, lion, meow </li>
			<li> Names: Bhatt, Serena, Jack </li>
		</ul>
		<p> Wow, I am so very hungry, I need to get energy since I have a lifegaurd interview for my beach job which means a lot is a stake here.  I can't bare imagining how sad I would be if I didn't get the job, I would be lieing to my self if I thought I would survive.  I like meetings and interviews but at least in mee-OWW lego bricks are deadly!  Anyway I was saying that at least in meetings it isn't one bad lifegaurd who is jacked and talks in slang.  I imagine him or her saying something like: sorry nah; at the end of the interview, man I need to relax. </p>
		<h1 id="Knock"> What Is A Knock Knock Joke? </h1>
		<p> A knock knock joke is an old and simple formula to make a joke where one person will say knock knock as if to knock on a door, the second person would respon who's there to see who or whats at the door then the first replies with a setup such as I eat mop which the second person must repeat and add the word who at the end of the phrase then ending the joke with a final remark from person a. Here is a complete example: </p>
		<p class="a"> Person A: Knock Knock </p>
		<p class="b"> Person B: Who's There? </p>
		<p class="a"> Person B: I eat mop (this is the setup)</p>
		<p class="b"> Person B: I eat mop who? </p>
		<p class="a"> Person A: Eww!  Why would you do that! (this is the punchline) </p>

		<p> If you don't understand the joke try saying it outloud or to a friend </p>

		<p> Since knock knock jokes are and old and simple premise most of the jokes that can be done have so if you're lazy you can search <a href="https://www.rd.com/jokes/knock-knock/">some up</a> but if you want to make one like the reason you're on this webpage for the simplist way is to thing of a word or phrase that ends with a who and say it as the setup removing the who part and make person b realize what they just said by having a reaction to it for the punchline similar to the first example.  For example you could say yoodelayhee for your setup and after person b retells your words blandly you could sing yoodelayhee-who back to them which is yordling. </p>
